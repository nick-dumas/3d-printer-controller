This project is a 3D printer controller board.

The goals are (in the following order):
 * Safety (No electrical/fire hazards)
 * Print quality on par with the Duet
 * Modularity on par with ramps
 * Hobbiest level assembly difficulty
 * Cheap

It is intended to be used with a 24v LED strip switching PSU, as well as an external 5v buck-boost regulator.
